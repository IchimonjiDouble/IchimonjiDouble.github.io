## Academic Experience
### Research Assistant at School of Environmental and Ecological Engineering
May 2018- Present

Supervised by Dr. John W. Sutherland, collaborating with research partners in Critical Materials Institute (CMI), conduct techno-economic analysis (TEA) on their new material recycling technologies. Study estimation method for research projects at early technology readiness level. Develop and upgrade user-friendly TEA software using Python. Offer TEA consultations through annual meetings and webinars.

### Research Assistant at School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University
January 2018-May 2018

Lead an undergraduate team to work on Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) innovation project, supervised by Dr. Yuehwern Yih. This is an evidence-based, life-saving intervention for preterm infants that requires family-centered care in developing countries. Establish a simulation model to analyze the patient flow in the nursery ward using SIMIO, providing supportive information to the system layout design improvement.

### Teaching Assistant at School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University
August 2016-December 2016

Serve as the Teaching Assistant for course IE 590 Big Data Optimization, instructed by Dr. Gesualdo Scutari. This is a graduate level course regarding models and algorithms for large-scale nonlinear optimization. This Course requires high level advanced mathematical background.

Responsible for checking the class attendance, compiling standard solutions and programming codes, grading the assignments and tests, answering questions, and gathering feedbacks from students. 

### Research Assistant at School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University                                           
May 2016-August 2016

Supervised by Dr. Harsha Honnappa, analyze a tandem queueing network at which jobs are arriving in batches, and arrival/service rates vary according to the environmental phases. The final goal is to study its potential bottleneck. By using the fluid approximation and diffusion approximation, appropriately approximate the queue length and workload process by fluid or diffusion processes, to further analyze its bottleneck phenomena. Mathematic analysis, measurement theory, matrix calculus, probability theory are involved in this project.

## Professional Experience:
## CI Specialist in Gate Gourmet (Hong Kong)  
June 2017-December 2017

Serve as continuous improvement specialist to optimize existing airline food catering system, supervised by manager Claudio Micucci. Work closely with different internal departments to capture and analyze users’ requirements. Conduct current processes and procedures review to identify improvement chances on a regular basis and propose feasible solutions to enhance production efficiency and effectiveness. 

Data Analysis, regression analysis, and simulation modeling are required for this position.
